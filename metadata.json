If you were explicitly referencing this attribute\nin your recipes, you will need to update all usages to a string, or remove each usage to rely on the default value ('TCP'):\n\n```\n    windows_firewall_rule 'Apache' do\n          protocol 'TCP' # was protocol :TCP\n          ...\n    end\n```\n\n# Requirements\nVersion 2.0.0+ of this cookbook requires Chef 11+\n\n## Platforms\n\n* Windows Vista\n* Windows 7\n* Windows 8\n* Windows Server 2008\n* Windows Server 2008R2\n* Windows Server 2012\n* Windows Server 2012R2\n\n## Usage\nIn your recipe, you can use the `windows_firewall_rule` resource.  Currently, the only supported action is `:create`. Attribute defaults match the netsh advfirewall defaults if they are required by netsh advfirewall, otherwise they are set to 'nil'.\n\nThis is a resource-only cookbook, and adding the default recipe to a node's runlist will have no effect.\n\n## Resources\n\n### windows_firewall_rule\n\n#### Actions\n\n:create - creates a firewall rule with the parameters supplied\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `name` Name attribute.
