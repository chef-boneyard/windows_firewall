# windows_firewall Cookbook

This cookbook configures Windows firewall rules.

## **3.0 Breaking Changes**

The protocol attribute was changed from a symbol to a string. If you were explicitly referencing this attribute in your recipes, you will need to update all usages to a string, or remove each usage to rely on the default value ('TCP'):

```
    windows_firewall_rule 'Apache' do
          protocol 'TCP' # was protocol :TCP
          ...
    end
```

# Requirements

## Chef

- 12.7+

## Platforms

- Windows Vista
- Windows 7
- Windows 8
- Windows Server 2008
- Windows Server 2008R2
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012R2

## Usage

In your recipe, you can use the `windows_firewall_rule` resource. Currently, the only supported action is `:create`. Attribute defaults match the netsh advfirewall defaults if they are required by netsh advfirewall, otherwise they are set to 'nil'.

This is a resource-only cookbook, and adding the default recipe to a node's runlist will have no effect.
